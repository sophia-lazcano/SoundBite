        Clefs, clefs, and more clefs galore! Musical clefs are a symbol in written music that establish what notes the staff (the five horizontal lines that hold
        the notes) holds, as well as their relative pitch (high, low, *really* low, etc.). Technically, there are about 6 established clefs, however, there are 2
        main clefs widely used by many instruments. These 2 clefs are the Treble and Bass Clefs. Treble clefs are usually used for higher pitch intruments, like
        flutes, clarients, and trumpets. Bass Clefs are usually used to write music for lower pitched instruments, like tubas, trombones, and baritones. There
        are even instruments that utilize both, like piano and guitar. Knowing these 2 clefs is the first step in understanding the most mainstream music sheets.
        Read more below to find out how each clef is organized and what each line/space in the staff represents in all the notes' glory.

        The Treble Clef is the most famous clef. Normally used to depict the pitches of higher-sounding intruments, they represent the notes FACE (the
        spaces in the staff starting from the bottom-up) and the notes EGBDF (the lines of the staff starting from the bottom-up) to make a combined EFGABCDEF
        from bottom to top. Notice how some notes seem to repeat, but they are not the same! Notes of the same letter name but different placement represent a
        difference in pitch, called an octave interval, where one is higher or lower sounding than the other, depending on how you look at it. A good way to
        remember what notes are is to use acronyms! For space notes, "FACE", and for line notes, "Every Good Boy Does Fine", and more. Use whatever helps you best.
        Another great characteristic of the treble clef is that the swirl of its bottom-half centers on the note G (on the line). Even though the staff is
        limited to 9 notes within, notes can actually extend past the bottom or the top of the clef, given that you follow the same rules of jumping from line
        to space to line to space (etc.) in alphabetical order from A-G (never H or beyond!). These notes usually rest on extra line segments called ledger lines.

        The Bass Clef is arguably the second most famous clef. This clef is normally used to depict the pitches of lower-sounding intruments, they represent
        the notes ACEG (the spaces in the staff starting from the bottom-up) and the notes GBDFA (the lines of the staff starting from the bottom-up) to make
        a combined GABCDEFGA from bottom to top. Notice how some notes seem to repeat, however, they are not the same note! Notes of the same letter name but
        different placement represent a difference in pitch, called an octave interval, where one is higher or lower-sounding than the other, depending on how
        you look at it. A good way to remember what notes are is to use acronyms! For space notes, "Ally Craves Excellent Grapes", and for line notes, "Good
        Boys Do Fine, Always", and more. Use whatever helps you best. Another great characteristic of the bass clef is that the two dots to the right of the swirl
        hold the note F (on the line) in between them. Even though the staff is limited to 9 notes within, notes can actually extend past the bottom or the top of
        the clef, given that you follow the same rules of jumping from line to space to line to space (etc.) in alphabetical order from A-G (never H or beyond!).
