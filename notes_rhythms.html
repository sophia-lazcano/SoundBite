    Notes and rests are the individual parts that create a piece of music through sound and silence in rhythm, respectively. The most basic types of notes and
    rests begin with a value of 4 and progress to each step by dividing in half the value. The table shown displays the most common types of notes, from whole,
    half, quarter, eighth, sixteenth, and thirty-second notes and rests. After that, the symbols progress more or less the same, adding a flag for each
    progressed level (for example, a 64th note/rest has 4 flags). Each staff line is split up into segments called measures, which contain an equal amount of
    beats per segment until stated otherwise (in the intermediate concept of time signature changes). However, for now, let's focus on the nice, round number
    of a common time signature, which is 4/4 (read as "four four"), or also denoted as "C" for common time. This means that the measure gets 4 beats (indicated
    in the numerator), where every beat is given to a quarter (1/4) note (indicated in the denominator).
