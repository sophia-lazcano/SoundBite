        Pitch is best described as the frequency of a note that is on an audible spectrum from the lowest to the highest pitches. Everytime you hear a single note's
        tone, you are hearing the note's pitch! A blend of pitches makes a song, where we have described them as musical notes. Believe it or not, some people can
        actually tell what note is being played based on the pitch they hear alone. Study the notes' pitches and play the game below to see if you have perfect pitch!
